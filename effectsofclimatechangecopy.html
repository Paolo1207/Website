                        Climate change is our planet’s greatest existential threat. If we don’t limit greenhouse gas emissions from the burning of fossil fuels, the consequences of rising global temperatures include massive crop and fishery collapse, the disappearance of hundreds of thousands of species, and entire communities becoming uninhabitable.<br><br>
                        While these outcomes may still be avoidable, climate change is already causing suffering and death. From raging wildfires and supercharged storms, its compounding effects can be felt today, outside our own windows.<br><br>
                        <strong>Effects of climate change on weather</strong><br>
                        <strong>Higher average temperatures:</strong> This change in global average temperature seemingly small but consequential and climbing means that, each summer, we are likely to experience increasingly sweltering heat waves.<br>
                        <strong>Stronger storms:</strong> Warmer air also holds more moisture, making tropical cyclones wetter, stronger, and more capable of rapidly intensifying. In the latest report from the IPCC, scientists found that daily rainfall during extreme precipitation events would increase by about 7 percent for each degree Celsius of global warming, increasing the dangers of flooding.<br><br>
                        <strong>Effects of climate change on the environment</strong><br>
                        <strong>Sea level rise:</strong> Scientists predict that melting sea ice and glaciers, as well as the fact that warmer water expands in volume, could cause sea levels to rise as much as 6.6 feet by the end of the century, should we fail to curb emissions.<br>
                        <strong>Flooding:</strong> In addition to coastal flooding caused by sea level rise, climate change influences the factors that result in inland and urban flooding: snowmelt and heavy rain.<br><br>
                        <strong>Effects of climate change on agriculture</strong><br>
                        <strong>Less predictable growing seasons:</strong> In a warming world, farming crops is more unpredictable—and livestock, which are sensitive to extreme weather, become harder to raise. Climate change shifts precipitation patterns, causing unpredictable floods and longer-lasting droughts.<br>
                        <strong>Food shortages:</strong> Ultimately, impacts to our agricultural systems pose a direct threat to the global food supply. And food shortages and price hikes driven by climate change will not affect everyone equally: Wealthier people will continue to have more options for accessing food.<br><br>
                        <strong>Effects of climate change on animals</strong><br>
                        <strong>It’s about far more than just the polar bears:</strong> Half of all animal species in the world’s most biodiverse places, like the Amazon rainforest and the Galapagos Islands, are at risk of extinction from climate change. And climate change is threatening species that are already suffering from the biodiversity crisis, which is driven primarily by changes in land and ocean use (like converting wild places to farmland) and direct exploitation of species (like overfishing and wildlife trade).<br><br>
                        <strong>Effects of climate change on humans</strong><br>
                        <strong>Ultimately, the way climate change impacts weather, the environment, animals, and agriculture affects humanity as well:</strong> But there’s more. Around the world, our ways of life—from how we get our food to the industries around which our economies are based—have all developed in the context of relatively stable climates. As global warming shakes this foundation, it promises to alter the very fabric of society. At worst, this could lead to widespread famine, disease, war, displacement, injury, and death.<br><br>
                        <strong>Summarized:</strong><br>
                        Climate change poses a critical threat to our planet's survival. Without reducing greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels, we face severe consequences such as crop failures, loss of biodiversity, and uninhabitable regions. The impacts, already evident through extreme weather events like wildfires and storms, are only escalating. Rising temperatures lead to more intense heatwaves, while warmer air fuels stronger storms with heavier rainfall. Sea levels are projected to rise significantly due to melting ice and expanding water volume, causing coastal and inland flooding. Agriculture suffers from unpredictable growing seasons and food shortages, affecting global food security. Species extinction rates soar, with half of all animals in biodiverse regions at risk. Beyond environmental effects, climate change threatens human societies, disrupting economies and increasing the likelihood of famine, disease, and conflict.
